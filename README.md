# Coqui-Sonic-Characters-TTS
Instead of using other greedy "AI" websites, why not run it on your PC! You can use the "issues" to post your model here after training it via coqui TTS!!! Make sure to list which is trained (Tacotron, VITS, and more) including which one have a vocoder or NOT!



I found this video: https://youtu.be/e_DCb1XPWS0

It's a way that I trained my voice model, using google colab! (Planning to use my own GPU since I realized mine is also capable!)
--Google colab from the video isn't working so use my modified one!

So, please as a small request, we can expand this into a bigger pile of casts from the sonic characters! This way no need to wait for queue and then we can all go back to making TTS videos without any single problems! One small voice model open to everyone can be used for everything, for I had faith in open source tools.

Still waiting for CoquiTTS gui to be made tho :( 

[Where u can load models too]

	Completed Models:
	Silver the hedgehog (Pete Capella)

  If you don't know how to run coqui-TTS models, check the CoquiTTS repository.
